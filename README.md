# Project Overview

In this project, we will explore data related to the One Piece anime. The data contains information on the characters, episodes, and ratings of the anime. We will use Python to perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.

## Data

We will use the following datasets for our analysis:

- **`characters.csv`**: Contains information on the characters in the anime, including their name, age, and affiliation.
- **`episodes.csv`**: Contains information on the episodes in the anime, including the episode number, title, airdate, rating score and the number of votes.

### Step 1: Data Preparation

The first step in our analysis is to load and prepare the data. We will use the pandas library for this purpose.

### Step 2: Data Exploration

Next, we will explore the data to gain insights. We can start by looking at the distribution of ratings.
We can also look at the average rating by season.
We can also explore the character data to see which affiliation has the most characters.

### Step 3: Conclusion

In this project, we explored data related to the One Piece anime using Python. We looked at the distribution of ratings, the average rating by season, and the number of characters by affiliation. These insights can be used to better understand the anime and its audience.
